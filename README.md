# c-elegans-home-lab
# 🧬 Home C. elegans Behavioral Neuroscience Lab

Welcome to my independent neuroscience research lab, built at home to explore behavior, neurochemistry, and locomotion in *Caenorhabditis elegans*. This project is a personal initiative to gain hands-on experimental experience, develop behavioral assays, and prepare for a career in behavioral genetics or neuroscience research.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Investigate how neuromodulators like serotonin affect *C. elegans* locomotion
- Build low-cost assays using open-source hardware and software
- Develop an analysis pipeline to quantify behavioral metrics (speed, reversals, pauses)
- Document everything transparently for future publication, sharing, or collaboration

---

## 🧠 Research Focus

The first set of experiments will examine how **serotonin exposure** alters locomotion patterns in young adult *C. elegans*. Using home microscopy and video tracking, I aim to:
- Measure average speed before and after exposure
- Quantify pausing and directional reversals
- Compare behavioral outcomes across doses
